            <h2>Test and Product Engineering</h2>

                    <p>Test and product engineering (TPE) is a discipline in the integrated circuit industry that uses automated test equipment to validate the specifications for integrated circuit chips. The intent is to verify that a fabrication defect does not impact the performance of the chip, so every chip fabricated should be tested. As the levels of integrated circuit integration, cost, speed, power, compactness, and functionality improve, the challenges to testing integrated circuits are continually rising. Faculty members at RHIT have developed courses to provide students with a background and certificate in test and product engineering.</p>

            <h2>Courses Developed</h2>
            <hr class="small">
                <div>    
                    <p>Three test and product engineering courses have been developed covering the different testing methodologies required for different domains. All three courses use an industry-grade automatic tester in the lab/project assignments.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href = "/courses/analog/index.html"><b>Analog Test and Product Engineering</b></a></li>
                            <p>This course covers the foundations of test and product engineering including fabrication defects, test equipment limitations, test board generation, test plan development, and statistical analysis of results. The test-time versus test-accuracy tradeoff and its economic implications is explored in great detail, driving the use of digital-signal processing techniques. </p>
                        <li><a href = "/courses/digital/index.html"><b>Digital Test and Product Engineering</b></a></li>
                            <p>Testing strategies for microcontrollers, digital systems, and memory are examined in this course. There is a focus on common digital-system fault modeling, test generation, and design for testability.</p>
                        <li><a href = "/courses/mixedsignal/index.html"><b>Mixed-Signal Test and Product Engineering</b></a></li>
                            <p>This course describes the testing of mixed-signal chips such as comparators, DACs, and ADCs. Most of the test and product engineering foundation material is covered briefly. After describing the functionality of common mixed-signal circuit structures, the combination of analog and digital testing techniques required to test mixed-signal parts are explored. </p>                
                    </ul>
                    More details about these courses and materials used to teach these topics can be found on the individual course pages.

            <h2>Educational Benefits</h2>
            <hr class="small">
                <div>    
                    <p>Test and Product Engineering courses are great capstone courses that integrate many undergraduate concepts together and integrate them together in an industry focused real-world application. 
                    </p>
                     <img src = "/img/educationalBenefits.PNG"> <br>
                    <p>All courses have been developed using techniques shown in education research to foster higher levels of intellectual development. Particular emphasis has been placed on the development of <b>critical thinking skills</b>.  Student assessment before and after the course showed that critical thinking skills, particularly in the areas of data analysis, alternative explanations for a set of data, and real-world problem solving , exhibited significant improvements as a result of the students' experiences in these courses. </p>
                    <p>These courses were developed in conjunction with our Industrial Partners, who provided insight into the course material and skills needed by the integrated circuit industry.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Companies receive students with a special set of skills. Students will have a solid foundation in integrated-circuit testing, a rich experience with open-ended problem solving, improved critical thinking skills, and breadth in the integrated-circuit area.</p>
