            TPE stands for Test and Product Engineering.
            The Test and Product Engineering courses developed at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology have the following characteristics:    
                <p>Use of automated test equipment to validate the specifications for integrated circuit chips including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analog integrated circuits</li>  
                        <li>Mixed-Signal integrated circuits (DAC and ADC)</li>
                        <li>Microcontrollers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                Course and lab opportunities designed to develop critical thinking skills. <br>
                Emphasis on test-time vs. test-accuracy tradeoff. <br>
                Hands-on labs provide student use of industry-grade test equipment and experiences with industry test procedures. <br>
                Course and labs developed in conjunction with industrial partners: <br>
