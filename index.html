           <h2>Test and Product Engineering</h2>

                <p>Test and product engineering (TPE) is a discipline in the integrated circuit industry that uses automated test equipment to validate the specifications for integrated circuit chips. The intent is to verify that a fabrication defect does not impact the performance of the chip, so every chip fabricated should be tested. As the levels of integrated circuit integration, cost, speed, power, compactness, and functionality improve, the challenges to testing integrated circuits are continually rising. Faculty members at RHIT have developed courses to provide students with a background and certificate in test and product engineering.</p>

            <h2>Courses Developed</h2>

            <div>    
                <p>Three test and product engineering courses have been developed covering the different testing methodologies required for different domains. All three courses use an industry-grade automatic tester in the lab/project assignments.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Analog Test and Product Engineering</b></li>
                        <p>This course covers the foundations of test and product engineering including fabrication defects, test equipment limitations, test board generation, test plan development, and statistical analysis of results. The test-time versus test-accuracy tradeoff and its economic implications is explored in great detail, driving the use of digital-signal processing techniques. </p>
                    <li><b>Digital Test and Product Engineering</b></li>
                        <p>Testing strategies for microcontrollers, digital systems, and memory are examined in this course. There is a focus on common digital-system fault modeling, test generation, and design for testability.</p>
                    <li><b>Mixed-Signal Test and Product Engineering</b></li>
                        <p>This course describes the testing of mixed-signal chips such as comparators, DACs, and ADCs. Most of the test and product engineering foundation material is covered briefly. After describing the functionality of common mixed-signal circuit structures, the combination of analog and digital testing techniques required to test mixed-signal parts are presented. </p>                
                </ul>
                Examples of materials used in the courses can be found on the individual course pages.
