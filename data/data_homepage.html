                    <p>The mixed-signal DIB is used to test (i) the TLV5616 DAC (top socket), (ii) the ADS7822 ADC (bottom socket), and (iii) the MCP6541 Comparator (PDIP package) using a daughter card that attaches to the mixed-signal DIB. </p>
                    <p><br><i>Page 1</i> shows the socket connections and loads for the DAC and ADC. The DAC socket is dual site, with site 1 at the top of the socket and site 2 at the bottom of the socket.
                    <br><i>Page 2</i> shows relay controls and filtering capability for the reference voltages for the DAC and ADC. The reference voltages were driven directly with a voltage source (APU4 and 5) for our data.
                    <br><i>Page 3</i> shows the header connections for the daughter card. Instrument connections are passed from the mixed-signal DIB to the daughter card through these header pins.
                    <br><i>Pages 4 and 5</i> show the fixed power-supply connections. </p>

                    <p>The Comparator Daughter Card DIB is used with the Mixed-Signal DIB to test the MCP6541 comparator chip. </p>
                    <p><i>Pages 1 and 2</i> show the socket connections for site 1 and site 2.
                    <br><i>Page 3-5</i> show the loading options for the comparator. </p>
