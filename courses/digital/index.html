            <hr class="small">
               <p>The Digital Test and Product Engineering course teaches the foundations of test and product engineering for digital circuits, processors and memory. Students are exposed to practices of test design and analysis for general digital circuits, but also have the opportunity to apply practices on the testing of an 8-bit microcontroller in laboratory activities.  Working with a microcontroller provides students with experience understanding the design and architecture of a complex digital system.  Students must develop the skills needed to interpret the data sheet for complex systems such as microcontrollers, and to use these resources to understand the architecture and operation of the components in order to design an appropriate test. </p>
