            <hr class="small">
                <p>The Analog Test and Product Engineering course teaches the foundations of test and product engineering using an op-amp. Student familiarity with the op-amp allows more time to be focused on the test and product engineering concepts and less time on circuit foundations. Yet testing a simple op-amp requires feedback control, a thorough understanding of the data sheets, a variety of part specifications and instrument requirements, and provides the opportunity to use digital-signal processing testing techniques. </p>
