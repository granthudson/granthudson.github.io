            <h2>Mixed-Signal Test and Product Engineering Course</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>The Mixed-Signal Test and Product Engineering course combines analog and digital testing techniques. Particular attention is placed on integrating the analog source/measurement units with the digital source/measurement units to obtain the correct timing for driving and measuring the mixed-signal parts. A significant amount of time is required to teach the typical circuit structures underlying the data converters since students do not have this background and the circuit changes the testing techniques. Like the Analog TPE course, students are expected to use statistical analysis to optimize test programs for speed versus accuracy. </p>
